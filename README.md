# NCL Mobile Technical Assessment

## Overview

This is a single screen app that displays 3 buttons that when clicked, diplays the name, passsenger capacity, crew and inaugural date for the respective cruise ship.
I have included tests for the screen, widget, service, and bloc used to create this app.
